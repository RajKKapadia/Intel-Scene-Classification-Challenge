# Intel-Scene-Classification-Challenge
Hello, this is my solution for the Intel Scene Classification Challenge on [AnalyticsVidhya.](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-intel-scene-classification-challe/)

I have created my own DataGenerator Class and CNN Model.

You can find the data on [Google Drive.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QPaHuq8Jl7jySgmc_dI9KEiy8rgbINke)

Add the data to your Google Drive.
Create a new colaboratory file in the folder where the data is.


**Enjoy The Life Feel The Music.**
